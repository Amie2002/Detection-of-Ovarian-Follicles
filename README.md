# Detection-of-Ovarian-Follicles
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on the detection and classification of ovarian follicles using the MobileNetV2 architecture. Ovarian follicles play a crucial role in reproductive health, and accurate detection and classification are essential for various medical applications.

## Features:
- MobileNetV2 Architecture: Leveraging the efficiency and effectiveness of the MobileNetV2 architecture for image classification tasks.
- Dataset: Includes 34 histological section images from 6 mouse ovaries, with 29 sections allocated for training and 5 for testing.
- Annotations: Each section is annotated with ground truth follicle locations and categories, stored in CSV files.
- Negative Class: Introduces a "Negative" class to handle areas without positive follicle examples.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes standard evaluation metrics for assessing model performance.
